# The length property

<div>

Every string has a `length` property, which
is equal to the number of characters in the string:

    var str:String = "Adobe";
    trace(str.length);            // output: 5

An empty string and a null string both have a length of 0, as the
following example shows:

    var str1:String = new String();
    trace(str1.length);           // output: 0

    str2:String = '';
    trace(str2.length);           // output: 0

</div>
