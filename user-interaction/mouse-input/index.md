# Mouse input

Your application can create interactivity by capturing and responding to mouse
input. Note that this section assumes that you are already familiar with the
ActionScript 3.0 event model. For more information, see
[Handling events](../../core-actionscript-classes/handling-events/index.md).

For information on discovering what kind of mouse support is available (such as
persistent cursor, stylus or touch input) during runtime, see
[Discovering input types](../basics-of-user-interaction.md#discovering-input-types).
