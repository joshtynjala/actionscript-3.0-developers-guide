# Reading from and writing to the system clipboard

To read the operating system clipboard, call the `getData()` method of the
`Clipboard.generalClipboard` object, passing in the name of the format to read:

    import flash.desktop.Clipboard;
    import flash.desktop.ClipboardFormats;

    if(Clipboard.generalClipboard.hasFormat(ClipboardFormats.TEXT_FORMAT)){
    var text:String = Clipboard.generalClipboard.getData(ClipboardFormats.TEXT_FORMAT);
    }

> **Note:** Content running in Flash Player or in a non-application sandbox in
> AIR can call the `getData()` method only in an event handler for a `paste`
> event. In other words, only code running in the AIR application sandbox can
> call the `getData()` method outside of a `paste` event handler.

To write to the clipboard, add the data to the `Clipboard.generalClipboard`
object in one or more formats. Any existing data in the same format is
overwritten automatically. Nevertheless, it is a good practice to also clear the
system clipboard before writing new data to it to make sure that unrelated data
in any other formats is also deleted.

    import flash.desktop.Clipboard;
    import flash.desktop.ClipboardFormats;

    var textToCopy:String = "Copy to clipboard.";
    Clipboard.generalClipboard.clear();
    Clipboard.generalClipboard.setData(ClipboardFormats.TEXT_FORMAT, textToCopy, false);

> **Note:** Content running in Flash Player or in a non-application sandbox in
> AIR can call the `setData()` method only in an event handler for a user event,
> such as a keyboard or mouse event, or a `copy` or `cut` event. In other words,
> only code running in the AIR application sandbox can call the `setData()`
> method outside of a user event handler.
