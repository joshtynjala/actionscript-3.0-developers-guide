# Drag and drop in AIR

<div>

Use the classes in the Adobe® AIR™ drag-and-drop API to support user-interface
drag-and-drop gestures. A _gesture_ in this sense is an action by the user,
mediated by both the operating system and your application, expressing an intent
to copy, move, or link information. A _drag-out_ gesture occurs when the user
drags an object out of a component or application. A _drag-in_ gesture occurs
when the user drags in an object from outside a component or application.

With the drag-and-drop API, you can allow a user to drag data between
applications and between components within an application. Supported transfer
formats include:

- Bitmaps

- Files

- HTML-formatted text

- Text

- Rich Text Format data

- URLs

- File promises

- Serialized objects

- Object references (only valid within the originating application)
