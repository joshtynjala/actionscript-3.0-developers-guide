# Dragging data out of an HTML element

<div>

The default behavior allows most content in an HTML page to be copied by
dragging. You can control the content allowed to be dragged using CSS properties
`-webkit-user-select` and `-webkit-user-drag`.

Override the default drag-out behavior in the handler for the `dragstart` event.
Call the `setData()` method of the `dataTransfer` property of the event object
to put your own data into the drag gesture.

To indicate which drag effects a source object supports when you are not relying
on the default behavior, set the `dataTransfer.effectAllowed` property of the
event object dispatched for the `dragstart` event. You can choose any
combination of effects. For example, if a source element supports both _copy_
and _link_ effects, set the property to `"copyLink"`.

## Setting the dragged data

<div>

Add the data for the drag gesture in the handler for the `dragstart` event with
the `dataTransfer` property. Use the `dataTransfer.setData()` method to put data
onto the clipboard, passing in the MIME type and the data to transfer.

For example, if you had an image element in your application, with the id
_imageOfGeorge_ , you could use the following dragstart event handler. This
example adds representations of a picture of George in several data formats,
which increases the likelihood that other applications can use the dragged data.

    function dragStartHandler(event){
    	event.dataTransfer.effectAllowed = "copy";

    	var dragImage = document.getElementById("imageOfGeorge");
    	var dragFile = new air.File(dragImage.src);
    	event.dataTransfer.setData("text/plain","A picture of George");
    	event.dataTransfer.setData("image/x-vnd.adobe.air.bitmap", dragImage);
    	event.dataTransfer.setData("application/x-vnd.adobe.air.file-list",
    								new Array(dragFile));
    }

<div>

Note: When you call the `setData()` method of `dataTransfer` object, no data is
added by the default drag-and-drop behavior.
