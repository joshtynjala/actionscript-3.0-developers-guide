# Virtual keyboards

Mobile devices, such as phones and tablets, often provide a virtual, software
keyboard instead of a physical one. The classes in the Flash API let you:

- Detect when the virtual keyboard is raised and when it closes.

- Prevent the keyboard from raising.

- Determine the area of the stage obscured by the virtual keyboard.

- Create interactive objects that raise the keyboard when they gain focus. (Not
  supported by AIR applications on iOS.)

- (AIR only) Disable the automatic panning behavior so that your application can
  modify its own display to accommodate the keyboard.
