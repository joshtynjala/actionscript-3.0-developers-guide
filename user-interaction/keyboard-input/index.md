# Keyboard input

Your application can capture and respond to keyboard input and can manipulate an
IME to let users type non-ASCII text characters in multibyte languages. Note
that this section assumes that you are already familiar with the ActionScript
3.0 event model. For more information, see
[Handling events](../../core-actionscript-classes/handling-events/index.md).

For information on discovering what kind of keyboard support is available (such
as physical, virtual, alphanumeric, or 12-button numeric) during runtime, see
[Discovering input types](../basics-of-user-interaction.md#discovering-input-types).

An Input Method Editor (IME) allows users to type complex characters and symbols
using a standard keyboard. You can use the IME classes to enable users to take
advantage of their system IME in your applications.
