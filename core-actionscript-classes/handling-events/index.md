# Handling events

<div>

An event-handling system allows programmers to respond to user input and
system events in a convenient way. The ActionScript 3.0 event model is
not only convenient, but also standards-compliant, and well integrated
with the display list. Based on the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3
Events Specification, an industry-standard event-handling architecture,
the new event model provides a powerful yet intuitive event-handling
tool for ActionScript programmers.

The ActionScript 3.0 event-handling system interacts closely with the
display list. To gain a basic understanding of the display list, read
[Display programming](../../display/index.md).
