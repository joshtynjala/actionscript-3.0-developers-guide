# Indexed arrays

<div>

Indexed arrays store a series of one or more values organized such that
each value can be accessed using an unsigned integer value. The first
index is always the number 0, and the index increments by 1 for each
subsequent element added to the array. In ActionScript 3.0, two classes
are used as indexed arrays: the Array class and the Vector class.

Indexed arrays use an unsigned 32-bit integer for the index number. The
maximum size of an indexed array is 2 <sup>32</sup> - 1 or
4,294,967,295. An attempt to create an array that is larger than the
maximum size results in a run-time error.

To access an individual element of an indexed array, you use the array
access ( `[]` ) operator to specify the index
position of the element you wish to access. For example, the following
code represents the first element (the element at index 0) in an indexed
array named `songTitles` :

    songTitles[0]

The combination of the array variable name followed by the index in
square brackets functions as a single identifier. (In other words, it
can be used in any way a variable name can). You can assign a value to
an indexed array element by using the name and index on the left side of
an assignment statement:

    songTitles[1] = "Symphony No. 5 in D minor";

Likewise, you can retrieve the value of an indexed array element by
using the name and index on the right side of an assignment statement:

    var nextSong:String = songTitles[2];

You can also use a variable in the square brackets rather than providing
an explicit value. (The variable must contain a non-negative integer
value such as a uint, a positive int, or a positive integer Number
instance). This technique is commonly used to “loop over” the elements
in an indexed array and perform an operation on some or all the
elements. The following code listing demonstrates this technique. The
code uses a loop to access each value in an Array object named
`oddNumbers`. It uses the
`trace()` statement to print each value in
the form “oddNumber\[ _index_ \] = _value_ ”:

    var oddNumbers:Array = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11];
    var len:uint = oddNumbers.length;
    for (var i:uint = 0; i < len; i++)
    {
        trace("oddNumbers[" + i.toString() + "] = " + oddNumbers[i].toString());
    }

<div>

#### The Array class

The first type of indexed array is the Array class. An Array instance
can hold a value of any data type. The same Array object can hold
objects that are of different data types. For example, a single Array
instance can have a String value in index 0, a Number instance in index
1, and an XML object in index 2.

</div>

<div>

#### The Vector class

Another type of indexed array that’s available in ActionScript 3.0 is
the Vector class. A Vector instance is a _typed array_, which means
that all the elements in a Vector instance always have the same data
type.

<div>

Note: The Vector class is available starting with Flash Player 10 and
Adobe AIR 1.5.

</div>

When you declare a Vector variable or instantiate a Vector object, you
explicitly specify the data type of the objects that the Vector can
contain. The specified data type is known as the Vector’s _base type_.
At run time and at compile time (in strict mode), any code that sets the
value of a Vector element or retrieves a value from a Vector is checked.
If the data type of the object being added or retrieved doesn’t match
the Vector’s base type, an error occurs.

In addition to the data type restriction, the Vector class has other
restrictions that distinguish it from the Array class:

- A Vector is a dense array. An Array object may have values in
  indices 0 and 7 even if it has no values in positions 1 through 6.
  However, a Vector must have a value (or
  `null` ) in each index.

- A Vector can optionally be fixed-length. This means that the number
  of elements the Vector contains can’t change.

- Access to a Vector’s elements is bounds-checked. You can never read
  a value from an index greater than the final element (
  `length` - 1). You can never set a
  value with an index more than one beyond the current final index.
  (In other words, you can only set a value at an existing index or at
  index `[length]` .)

As a result of its restrictions, a Vector has three primary benefits
over an Array instance whose elements are all instances of a single
class:

- Performance: array element access and iteration are much faster when
  using a Vector instance than when using an Array instance.

- Type safety: in strict mode the compiler can identify data type
  errors. Examples of such errors include assigning a value of the
  incorrect data type to a Vector or expecting the wrong data type
  when reading a value from a Vector. At run time, data types are also
  checked when adding data to or reading data from a Vector object.
  Note, however, that when you use the
  `push()` method or
  `unshift()` method to add values to
  a Vector, the arguments’ data types are not checked at compile time.
  When using those methods the values are still checked at run time.

- Reliability: runtime range checking (or fixed-length checking)
  increases reliability significantly over Arrays.

Aside from the additional restrictions and benefits, the Vector class is
very much like the Array class. The properties and methods of a Vector
object are similar—for the most part identical—to the properties and
methods of an Array. In most situations where you would use an Array in
which all the elements have the same data type, a Vector instance is
preferable.

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Creating arrays

<div>

You can use several techniques to create an Array instance or a Vector
instance. However, the techniques to create each type of array are
somewhat different.

</div>

<div>

### Creating an Array instance

<div>

You create an Array object by calling the
`Array()` constructor or by using Array
literal syntax.

The `Array()` constructor function can be
used in three ways. First, if you call the constructor with no
arguments, you get an empty array. You can use the
`length` property of the Array class to
verify that the array has no elements. For example, the following code
calls the `Array()` constructor with no
arguments:

    var names:Array = new Array();
    trace(names.length); // output: 0

Second, if you use a number as the only parameter to the
`Array()` constructor, an array of that
length is created, with each element’s value set to
`undefined`. The argument must be an
unsigned integer between the values 0 and 4,294,967,295. For example,
the following code calls the `Array()`
constructor with a single numeric argument:

    var names:Array = new Array(3);
    trace(names.length); // output: 3
    trace(names[0]); // output: undefined
    trace(names[1]); // output: undefined
    trace(names[2]); // output: undefined

Third, if you call the constructor and pass a list of elements as
parameters, an array is created, with elements corresponding to each of
the parameters. The following code passes three arguments to the
`Array()` constructor:

    var names:Array = new Array("John", "Jane", "David");
    trace(names.length); // output: 3
    trace(names[0]); // output: John
    trace(names[1]); // output: Jane
    trace(names[2]); // output: David

You can also create arrays with Array literals. An Array literal can be
assigned directly to an array variable, as shown in the following
example:

    var names:Array = ["John", "Jane", "David"];

</div>

</div>

<div>

### Creating a Vector instance

<div>

You create a Vector instance by calling the
`Vector.<T>()` constructor. You can also
create a Vector by calling the
`Vector.<T>()` global function. That
function converts a specified object to a Vector instance. In Flash
Professional CS5 and later, Flash Builder 4 and later, and Flex 4 and
later, you can also create a vector instance by using Vector literal
syntax.

Any time you declare a Vector variable (or similarly, a Vector method
parameter or method return type) you specify the base type of the Vector
variable. You also specify the base type when you create a Vector
instance by calling the `Vector.<T>()`
constructor. Put another way, any time you use the term
`Vector` in ActionScript, it is
accompanied by a base type.

You specify the Vector’s base type using type parameter syntax. The type
parameter immediately follows the word
`Vector` in the code. It consists of a
dot ( `.` ), then the base class name
surrounded by angle brackets ( `<>` ), as
shown in this example:

    var v:Vector.<String>;
    v = new Vector.<String>();

In the first line of the example, the variable
`v` is declared as a
`Vector.<String>` instance. In other
words, it represents an indexed array that can only hold String
instances. The second line calls the
`Vector()` constructor to create an
instance of the same Vector type (that is, a Vector whose elements are
all String objects). It assigns that object to
`v`.

<div>

#### Using the Vector.\<T\>() constructor

If you use the `Vector.<T>()`
constructor without any arguments, it creates an empty Vector instance.
You can test that a Vector is empty by checking its
`length` property. For example, the
following code calls the `Vector.<T>()`
constructor with no arguments:

    var names:Vector.<String> = new Vector.<String>();
    trace(names.length); // output: 0

If you know ahead of time how many elements a Vector initially needs,
you can pre-define the number of elements in the Vector. To create a
Vector with a certain number of elements, pass the number of elements as
the first parameter (the `length`
parameter). Because Vector elements can’t be empty, the elements are
filled with instances of the base type. If the base type is a reference
type that allows `null` values, the
elements all contain `null`.
Otherwise, the elements all contain the default value for the class. For
example, a uint variable can’t be
`null`. Consequently, in the following
code listing the Vector named `ages` is
created with seven elements, each containing the value 0:

    var ages:Vector.<uint> = new Vector.<uint>(7);
    trace(ages); // output: 0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Finally, using the `Vector.<T>()`
constructor you can also create a fixed-length Vector by passing
`true` for the second parameter (the
`fixed` parameter). In that case the
Vector is created with the specified number of elements and the number
of elements can’t be changed. Note, however, that you can still change
the values of the elements of a fixed-length Vector.

</div>

<div>

#### Using the Vector literal syntax constructor

In Flash Professional CS5 and later, Flash Builder 4 and later, and
Flex 4 and later, you can pass a list of values to the
`Vector.<T>()` constructor to specify
the Vector’s initial values:

    // var v:Vector.<T> = new <T>[E0, ..., En-1 ,];
    // For example:
    var v:Vector.<int> = new <int>[0,1,2,];

The following information applies to this syntax:

- The trailing comma is optional.

- Empty items in the array are not supported; a statement such as
  `var v:Vector.<int> = new <int>[0,,2,]`
  throws a compiler error.

- You can't specify a default length for the Vector instance. Instead,
  the length is the same as the number of elements in the
  initialization list.

- You can't specify whether the Vector instance has a fixed length.
  Instead, use the `fixed`
  property.

- <div>

  Data loss or errors can occur if items passed as values don't match
  the specified type. For example:
  var v:Vector.<int> = new <int>[4.2]; // compiler error when running in strict mode
  trace(v[0]); //returns 4 when not running in strict mode

  </div>

</div>

<div>

#### Using the Vector.\<T\>() global function

In addition to the `Vector.<T>()` and
Vector literal syntax constructors, you can also use the
`Vector.<T>()` global function to
create a Vector object. The
`Vector.<T>()` global function is a
conversion function. When you call the
`Vector.<T>()` global function you
specify the base type of the Vector that the method returns. You pass a
single indexed array (Array or Vector instance) as an argument. The
method then returns a Vector with the specified base type, containing
the values in the source array argument. The following code listing
shows the syntax for calling the
`Vector.<T>()` global function:

    var friends:Vector.<String> = Vector.<String>(["Bob", "Larry", "Sarah"]);

The `Vector.<T>()` global function
performs data type conversion on two levels. First, when an Array
instance is passed to the function, a Vector instance is returned.
Second, whether the source array is an Array or Vector instance the
function attempts to convert the source array’s elements to values of
the base type. The conversion uses standard ActionScript data type
conversion rules. For example, the following code listing converts the
String values in the source Array to integers in the result Vector. The
decimal portion of the first value (
`"1.5"` ) is truncated, and the
non-numeric third value ( `"Waffles"` )
is converted to 0 in the result:

    var numbers:Vector.<int> = Vector.<int>(["1.5", "17", "Waffles"]);
    trace(numbers); // output: 1,17,0

If any of the source elements can’t be converted, an error occurs.

When code calls the `Vector.<T>()`
global function, if an element in the source array is an instance of a
subclass of the specified base type, the element is added to the result
Vector (no error occurs). Using the
`Vector.<T>()` global function is the
only way to convert a Vector with base type
`T` to a Vector with a base type that’s
a superclass of `T`.

</div>

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Inserting array elements

<div>

The most basic way to add an element to an indexed array is to use the
array access ( `[]` ) operator. To set the
value of an indexed array element, use the Array or Vector object name
and index number on the left side of an assignment statement:

    songTitles[5] = "Happy Birthday";

If the Array or Vector doesn’t already have an element at that index,
the index is created and the value is stored there. If a value exists at
that index, the new value replaces the existing one.

An Array object allows you to create an element at any index. However,
with a Vector object you can only assign a value to an existing index or
to the next available index. The next available index corresponds to the
Vector object’s `length` property. The
safest way to add a new element to a Vector object is to use code like
this listing:

    myVector[myVector.length] = valueToAdd;

Three of the Array and Vector class methods—
`push()`,
`unshift()`, and
`splice()` —allow you to insert elements
into an indexed array. The `push()` method
appends one or more elements to the end of an array. In other words, the
last element inserted into the array using the
`push()` method will have the highest index
number. The `unshift()` method inserts one
or more elements at the beginning of an array, which is always at index
number 0. The `splice()` method will insert
any number of items at a specified index in the array.

The following example demonstrates all three methods. An array named
`planets` is created to store the names of
the planets in order of proximity to the Sun. First, the
`push()` method is called to add the
initial item, `Mars`. Second, the
`unshift()` method is called to insert the
item that belongs at the front of the array,
`Mercury`. Finally, the
`splice()` method is called to insert the
items `Venus` and
`Earth` after
`Mercury`, but before
`Mars`. The first argument sent to
`splice()`, the integer 1, directs the
insertion to begin at index 1. The second argument sent to
`splice()`, the integer 0, indicates that
no items should be deleted. Finally, the third and fourth arguments sent
to `splice()`,
`Venus` and
`Earth`, are the items to be inserted.

    var planets:Array = new Array();
    planets.push("Mars"); // array contents: Mars
    planets.unshift("Mercury"); // array contents: Mercury,Mars
    planets.splice(1, 0, "Venus", "Earth");
    trace(planets); // array contents: Mercury,Venus,Earth,Mars

The `push()` and
`unshift()` methods both return an unsigned
integer that represents the length of the modified array. The
`splice()` method returns an empty array
when used to insert elements, which may seem strange, but makes more
sense in light of the `splice()` method’s
versatility. You can use the `splice()`
method not only to insert elements into an array, but also to remove
elements from an array. When used to remove elements, the
`splice()` method returns an array
containing the elements removed.

<div>

Note: If a Vector object’s `fixed` property
is `true`, the total number of elements in
the Vector can’t change. If you try to add a new element to a
fixed-length Vector using the techniques described here, an error
occurs.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Retrieving values and removing array elements

<div>

The simplest way to retrieve the value of an element from an indexed
array is to use the array access ( `[]` )
operator. To retrieve the value of an indexed array element, use the
Array or Vector object name and index number on the right side of an
assignment statement:

    var myFavoriteSong:String = songTitles[3];

It’s possible to attempt to retrieve a value from an Array or Vector
using an index where no element exists. In that case, an Array object
returns the value undefined and a Vector throws a RangeError exception.

Three methods of the Array and Vector classes—
`pop()`,
`shift()`, and
`splice()` —allow you to remove elements.
The `pop()` method removes an element from
the end of the array. In other words, it removes the element at the
highest index number. The `shift()` method
removes an element from the beginning of the array, which means that it
always removes the element at index number 0. The
`splice()` method, which can also be used
to insert elements, removes an arbitrary number of elements starting at
the index number specified by the first argument sent to the method.

The following example uses all three methods to remove elements from an
Array instance. An Array named `oceans` is
created to store the names of large bodies of water. Some of the names
in the Array are lakes rather than oceans, so they need to be removed.

First, the `splice()` method is used to
remove the items `Aral` and
`Superior`, and insert the items
`Atlantic` and
`Indian`. The first argument sent to
`splice()`, the integer 2, indicates that
the operation should start with the third item in the list, which is at
index 2. The second argument, 2, indicates that two items should be
removed. The remaining arguments,
`Atlantic` and
`Indian`, are values to be inserted at
index 2.

Second, the `pop()` method is used to
remove last element in the array, `Huron`.
And third, the `shift()` method is used to
remove the first item in the array,
`Victoria`.

    var oceans:Array = ["Victoria", "Pacific", "Aral", "Superior", "Indian", "Huron"];
    oceans.splice(2, 2, "Arctic", "Atlantic"); // replaces Aral and Superior
    oceans.pop(); // removes Huron
    oceans.shift(); // removes Victoria
    trace(oceans);// output: Pacific,Arctic,Atlantic,Indian

The `pop()` and
`shift()` methods both return the item that
was removed. For an Array instance, the data type of the return value is
Object because arrays can hold values of any data type. For a Vector
instance, the data type of the return value is the base type of the
Vector. The `splice()` method returns an
Array or Vector containing the values removed. You can change the
`oceans` Array example so that the call to
`splice()` assigns the returned Array to a
new Array variable, as shown in the following example:

    var lakes:Array = oceans.splice(2, 2, "Arctic", "Atlantic");
    trace(lakes); // output: Aral,Superior

You may come across code that uses the
`delete` operator on an Array object
element. The `delete` operator sets the
value of an Array element to `undefined`,
but it does not remove the element from the Array. For example, the
following code uses the `delete` operator
on the third element in the `oceans` Array,
but the length of the Array remains 5:

    var oceans:Array = ["Arctic", "Pacific", "Victoria", "Indian", "Atlantic"];
    delete oceans[2];
    trace(oceans);// output: Arctic,Pacific,,Indian,Atlantic
    trace(oceans[2]); // output: undefined
    trace(oceans.length); // output: 5

You can truncate an Array or Vector using an array’s
`length` property. If you set the
`length` property of an indexed array to a
length that is less than the current length of the array, the array is
truncated, removing any elements stored at index numbers higher than the
new value of `length` minus 1. For example,
if the `oceans` array were sorted such that
all valid entries were at the beginning of the array, you could use the
`length` property to remove the entries at
the end of the array, as shown in the following code:

    var oceans:Array = ["Arctic", "Pacific", "Victoria", "Aral", "Superior"];
    oceans.length = 2;
    trace(oceans); // output: Arctic,Pacific

<div>

Note: If a Vector object’s `fixed` property
is `true`, the total number of elements in
the Vector can’t change. If you try to remove an element from or
truncate a fixed-length Vector using the techniques described here, an
error occurs.

</div>

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Sorting an array

<div>

There are three methods— `reverse()`,
`sort()`, and
`sortOn()` —that allow you to change the
order of an indexed array, either by sorting or reversing the order. All
of these methods modify the existing array. The following table
summarizes these methods and their behavior for Array and Vector
objects:

<div>

| Method      | Array behavior                                                                                                                                                   | Vector behavior                                                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `reverse()` | Changes the order of the elements so that the last element becomes the first element, the penultimate element becomes the second, and so on                      | Identical to Array behavior                                                   |
| `sort()`    | Allows you to sort the Array’s elements in a variety of predefined ways, such as alphabetical or numeric order. You can also specify a custom sorting algorithm. | Sorts the elements according to the custom sorting algorithm that you specify |
| `sortOn()`  | Allows you to sort objects that have one or more common properties, specifying the property or properties to use as the sort keys                                | Not available in the Vector class                                             |

</div>

<div>

#### The reverse() method

The `reverse()` method takes no
parameters and does not return a value, but allows you to toggle the
order of your array from its current state to the reverse order. The
following example reverses the order of the oceans listed in the
`oceans` array:

    var oceans:Array = ["Arctic", "Atlantic", "Indian", "Pacific"];
    oceans.reverse();
    trace(oceans); // output: Pacific,Indian,Atlantic,Arctic

</div>

<div>

#### Basic sorting with the sort() method (Array class only)

For an Array instance, the `sort()`
method rearranges the elements in an array using the _default sort
order_. The default sort order has the following characteristics:

- The sort is case-sensitive, which means that uppercase characters
  precede lowercase characters. For example, the letter D precedes the
  letter b.

- The sort is ascending, which means that lower character codes (such
  as A) precede higher character codes (such as B).

- The sort places identical values adjacent to each other but in no
  particular order.

- The sort is string-based, which means that elements are converted to
  strings before they are compared (for example, 10 precedes 3 because
  the string `"1"` has a lower
  character code than the string
  `"3"` has).

You may find that you need to sort your Array without regard to case, or
in descending order, or perhaps your array contains numbers that you
want to sort numerically instead of alphabetically. The Array class’s
`sort()` method has an
`options` parameter that allows you to
alter each characteristic of the default sort order. The options are
defined by a set of static constants in the Array class, as shown in the
following list:

- `Array.CASEINSENSITIVE` : This
  option makes the sort disregard case. For example, the lowercase
  letter b precedes the uppercase letter D.

- `Array.DESCENDING:` This reverses
  the default ascending sort. For example, the letter B precedes the
  letter A.

- `Array.UNIQUESORT:` This causes
  the sort to abort if two identical values are found.

- `Array.NUMERIC:` This causes
  numerical sorting, so that 3 precedes 10.

The following example highlights some of these options. An Array named
`poets` is created that is sorted using
several different options.

    var poets:Array = ["Blake", "cummings", "Angelou", "Dante"];
    poets.sort(); // default sort
    trace(poets); // output: Angelou,Blake,Dante,cummings

    poets.sort(Array.CASEINSENSITIVE);
    trace(poets); // output: Angelou,Blake,cummings,Dante

    poets.sort(Array.DESCENDING);
    trace(poets); // output: cummings,Dante,Blake,Angelou

    poets.sort(Array.DESCENDING | Array.CASEINSENSITIVE); // use two options
    trace(poets); // output: Dante,cummings,Blake,Angelou

</div>

<div>

#### Custom sorting with the sort() method (Array and Vector classes)

In addition to the basic sorting that’s available for an Array object,
you can also define a custom sorting rule. This technique is the only
form of the `sort()` method that is
available for the Vector class. To define a custom sort, you write a
custom sort function and pass it as an argument to the
`sort()` method.

For example, if you have a list of names in which each list element
contains a person’s full name, but you want to sort the list by last
name, you must use a custom sort function to parse each element and use
the last name in the sort function. The following code shows how this
can be done with a custom function that is used as a parameter to the
`Array.sort()` method:

    var names:Array = new Array("John Q. Smith", "Jane Doe", "Mike Jones");
    function orderLastName(a, b):int
    {
        var lastName:RegExp = /\b\S+$/;
        var name1 = a.match(lastName);
        var name2 = b.match(lastName);
        if (name1 < name2)
        {
            return -1;
        }
        else if (name1 > name2)
        {
            return 1;
        }
        else
        {
            return 0;
        }
    }
    trace(names); // output: John Q. Smith,Jane Doe,Mike Jones
    names.sort(orderLastName);
    trace(names); // output: Jane Doe,Mike Jones,John Q. Smith

The custom sort function
`orderLastName()` uses a regular
expression to extract the last name from each element to use for the
comparison operation. The function identifier
`orderLastName` is used as the sole
parameter when calling the `sort()`
method on the `names` array. The sort
function accepts two parameters, `a` and
`b`, because it works on two array
elements at a time. The sort function’s return value indicates how the
elements should be sorted:

- A return value of -1 indicates that the first parameter,
  `a`, precedes the second
  parameter, `b`.

- A return value of 1 indicates that the second parameter,
  `b`, precedes the first,
  `a`.

- A return value of 0 indicates that the elements have equal sorting
  precedence.

</div>

<div>

#### The sortOn() method (Array class only)

The `sortOn()` method is designed for
Array objects with elements that contain objects. These objects are
expected to have at least one common property that can be used as the
sort key. The use of the `sortOn()`
method for arrays of any other type yields unexpected results.

<div>

Note: The Vector class does not include a
`sortOn()` method. This method is only
available for Array objects.

</div>

The following example revises the `poets`
Array so that each element is an object instead of a string. Each object
holds both the poet’s last name and year of birth.

    var poets:Array = new Array();
    poets.push({name:"Angelou", born:"1928"});
    poets.push({name:"Blake", born:"1757"});
    poets.push({name:"cummings", born:"1894"});
    poets.push({name:"Dante", born:"1265"});
    poets.push({name:"Wang", born:"701"});

You can use the `sortOn()` method to sort
the Array by the `born` property. The
`sortOn()` method defines two parameters,
`fieldName` and
`options`. The
`fieldName` argument must be specified as
a string. In the following example,
`sortOn()` is called with two arguments,
" `born"` and
`Array.NUMERIC`. The
`Array.NUMERIC` argument is used to
ensure that the sort is done numerically instead of alphabetically. This
is a good practice even when all the numbers have the same number of
digits because it ensures that the sort will continue to behave as
expected if a number with fewer or more digits is later added to the
array.

    poets.sortOn("born", Array.NUMERIC);
    for (var i:int = 0; i < poets.length; ++i)
    {
        trace(poets[i].name, poets[i].born);
    }
    /* output:
    Wang 701
    Dante 1265
    Blake 1757
    cummings 1894
    Angelou 1928
    */

#### Sorting without modifying the original array (Array class only)

Generally, the `sort()` and
`sortOn()` methods modify an Array. If
you wish to sort an Array without modifying the existing array, pass the
`Array.RETURNINDEXEDARRAY` constant as
part of the `options` parameter. This
option directs the methods to return a new Array that reflects the sort
and to leave the original Array unmodified. The Array returned by the
methods is a simple Array of index numbers that reflects the new sort
order and does not contain any elements from the original Array. For
example, to sort the `poets` Array by
birth year without modifying the Array, include the
`Array.RETURNINDEXEDARRAY` constant as
part of the argument passed for the
`options` parameter.

The following example stores the returned index information in an Array
named `indices` and uses the
`indices` array in conjunction with the
unmodified `poets` array to output the
poets in order of birth year:

    var indices:Array;
    indices = poets.sortOn("born", Array.NUMERIC | Array.RETURNINDEXEDARRAY);
    for (var i:int = 0; i < indices.length; ++i)
    {
        var index:int = indices[i];
        trace(poets[index].name, poets[index].born);
    }
    /* output:
    Wang 701
    Dante 1265
    Blake 1757
    cummings 1894
    Angelou 1928
    */

## Querying an array

<div>

Four methods of the Array and Vector classes—
`concat()`,
`join()`,
`slice()`, and
`toString()` —all query the array for
information, but do not modify the array. The
`concat()` and
`slice()` methods both return new arrays,
while the `join()` and
`toString()` methods both return strings.
The `concat()` method takes a new array or
list of elements as arguments and combines it with the existing array to
create a new array. The `slice()` method
has two parameters, aptly named
`startIndex` and an
`endIndex`, and returns a new array
containing a copy of the elements “sliced” from the existing array. The
slice begins with the element at
`startIndex` and ends with the element just
before `endIndex`. That bears repeating:
the element at `endIndex` is not included
in the return value.

The following example uses `concat()` and
`slice()` to create new arrays using
elements of other arrays:

    var array1:Array = ["alpha", "beta"];
    var array2:Array = array1.concat("gamma", "delta");
    trace(array2); // output: alpha,beta,gamma,delta

    var array3:Array = array1.concat(array2);
    trace(array3); // output: alpha,beta,alpha,beta,gamma,delta

    var array4:Array = array3.slice(2,5);
    trace(array4); // output: alpha,beta,gamma

You can use the `join()` and
`toString()` methods to query the array and
return its contents as a string. If no parameters are used for the
`join()` method, the two methods behave
identically—they return a string containing a comma-delimited list of
all elements in the array. The `join()`
method, unlike the `toString()` method,
accepts a parameter named `delimiter`,
which allows you to choose the symbol to use as a separator between each
element in the returned string.

The following example creates an Array called
`rivers` and calls both
`join()` and
`toString()` to return the values in the
Array as a string. The `toString()` method
is used to return comma-separated values (
`riverCSV` ), while the
`join()` method is used to return values
separated by the `+` character.

    var rivers:Array = ["Nile", "Amazon", "Yangtze", "Mississippi"];
    var riverCSV:String = rivers.toString();
    trace(riverCSV); // output: Nile,Amazon,Yangtze,Mississippi
    var riverPSV:String = rivers.join("+");
    trace(riverPSV); // output: Nile+Amazon+Yangtze+Mississippi

One issue to be aware of with the `join()`
method is that any nested Array or Vector instances are always returned
with comma-separated values, no matter what separator you specify for
the main array elements, as the following example shows:

    var nested:Array = ["b","c","d"];
    var letters:Array = ["a",nested,"e"];
    var joined:String = letters.join("+");
    trace(joined); // output: a+b,c,d+e
