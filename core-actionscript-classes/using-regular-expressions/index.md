# Using regular expressions

<div>

A regular expression describes a pattern that is used to find and
manipulate matching text in strings. Regular expressions resemble
strings, but they can include special codes to describe patterns and
repetition. For example, the following regular expression matches a
string that starts with the character A followed by one or more
sequential digits:

    /A\d+/

The following topics describe the basic syntax for constructing regular
expressions. However, regular expressions can have many complexities and
nuances. You can find detailed resources on regular expressions on the
web and in bookstores. Keep in mind that different programming
environments implement regular expressions in different ways.
ActionScript 3.0 implements regular expressions as defined in the
ECMAScript edition 3 language specification (ECMA-262).
