# Creating an instance of a regular expression

<div>

There are two ways to create a regular expression instance. One way uses
forward slash characters ( `/` ) to delineate
the regular expression; the other uses the
`new` constructor. For example, the following
regular expressions are equivalent:

    var pattern1:RegExp = /bob/i;
    var pattern2:RegExp = new RegExp("bob", "i");

Forward slashes delineate a regular expression literal in the same way
as quotation marks delineate a string literal. The part of the regular
expression within the forward slashes defines the _pattern._ The regular
expression can also include _flags_ after the final delineating slash.
These flags are considered to be part of the regular expression, but
they are separate from its pattern.

When using the `new` constructor, you use two
strings to define the regular expression. The first string defines the
pattern, and the second string defines the flags, as in the following
example:

    var pattern2:RegExp = new RegExp("bob", "i");

When including a forward slash _within_ a regular expression that is
defined by using the forward slash delineators, you must precede the
forward slash with the backslash ( `\` )
escape character. For example, the following regular expression matches
the pattern `1/2` :

    var pattern:RegExp = /1\/2/;

To include quotation marks _within_ a regular expression that is defined
with the `new` constructor, you must add
backslash ( `\` ) escape character before the
quotation marks (just as you would when defining any String literal).
For example, the following regular expressions match the pattern
`eat at "joe's"` :

    var pattern1:RegExp = new RegExp("eat at \"joe's\"", "");
    var pattern2:RegExp = new RegExp('eat at "joe\'s"', "");

Do not use the backslash escape character with quotation marks in
regular expressions that are defined by using the forward slash
delineators. Similarly, do not use the escape character with forward
slashes in regular expressions that are defined with the
`new` constructor. The following regular
expressions are equivalent, and they define the pattern
`1/2 "joe's"` :

    var pattern1:RegExp = /1\/2 "joe's"/;
    var pattern2:RegExp = new RegExp("1/2 \"joe's\"", "");
    var pattern3:RegExp = new RegExp('1/2 "joe\'s"', '');

Also, in a regular expression that is defined with the
`new` constructor, to use a metasequence that
begins with the backslash ( `\` ) character,
such as `\d` (which matches any digit), type
the backslash character twice:

    var pattern:RegExp = new RegExp("\\d+", ""); // matches one or more digits

You must type the backlash character twice in this case, because the
first parameter of the `RegExp()` constructor
method is a string, and in a string literal you must type a backslash
character twice to have it recognized as a single backslash character.

The sections that follow describe syntax for defining regular expression
patterns.
