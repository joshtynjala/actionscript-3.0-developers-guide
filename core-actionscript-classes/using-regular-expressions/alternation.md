# Alternation

<div>

Use the `|` (pipe) character in a regular
expression to have the regular expression engine consider alternatives
for a match. For example, the following regular expression matches any
one of the words `cat, dog, pig, rat` :

    var pattern:RegExp = /cat|dog|pig|rat/;

You can use parentheses to define groups to restrict the scope of the \|
alternator. The following regular expression matches
`cat` followed by
`nap` or `nip` :

    var pattern:RegExp = /cat(nap|nip)/;

For more information, see
[Groups](./groups.md).

The following two regular expressions, one using the
`|` alternator, the other using a character
class (defined with `[` and
`]` ), are equivalent:

    /1|3|5|7|9/
    /[13579]/

For more information, see [Character classes](./character-classes.md).
