# Finding substrings and patterns in strings

<div>

Substrings are sequential characters within a string. For example, the string
`"abc"` has the following substrings: `""`, `"a"`, `"ab"`, `"abc"`, `"b"`,
`"bc"`, `"c"`. You can use ActionScript methods to locate substrings of a
string.

Patterns are defined in ActionScript by strings or by regular expressions. For
example, the following regular expression defines a specific patternâ€”the letters
A, B, and C followed by a digit character (the forward slashes are regular
expression delimiters):

    /ABC\d/

ActionScript includes methods for finding patterns in strings and for replacing
found matches with replacement substrings. These methods are described in the
following sections.

Regular expressions can define intricate patterns. For more information, see
[Using regular expressions](../using-regular-expressions/index.md).

## Finding a substring by character position

<div>

The `substr()` and `substring()` methods are similar. Both return a substring of
a string. Both take two parameters. In both methods, the first parameter is the
position of the starting character in the given string. However, in the
`substr()` method, the second parameter is the _length_ of the substring to
return, and in the `substring()` method, the second parameter is the position of
the character at the _end_ of the substring (which is not included in the
returned string). This example shows the difference between these two methods:

    var str:String = "Hello from Paris, Texas!!!";
    trace(str.substr(11,15)); // output: Paris, Texas!!!
    trace(str.substring(11,15)); // output: Pari

The `slice()` method functions similarly to the `substring()` method. When given
two non-negative integers as parameters, it works exactly the same. However, the
`slice()` method can take negative integers as parameters, in which case the
character position is taken from the end of the string, as shown in the
following example:

    var str:String = "Hello from Paris, Texas!!!";
    trace(str.slice(11,15)); // output: Pari
    trace(str.slice(-3,-1)); // output: !!
    trace(str.slice(-3,26)); // output: !!!
    trace(str.slice(-3,str.length)); // output: !!!
    trace(str.slice(-8,-3)); // output: Texas

You can combine non-negative and negative integers as the parameters of the
`slice()` method.

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Finding the character position of a matching substring

<div>

You can use the `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()` methods to locate matching
substrings within a string, as the following example shows:

    var str:String = "The moon, the stars, the sea, the land";
    trace(str.indexOf("the")); // output: 10

Notice that the `indexOf()` method is case-sensitive.

You can specify a second parameter to indicate the index position in the string
from which to start the search, as follows:

    var str:String = "The moon, the stars, the sea, the land"
    trace(str.indexOf("the", 11)); // output: 21

The `lastIndexOf()` method finds the last occurrence of a substring in the
string:

    var str:String = "The moon, the stars, the sea, the land"
    trace(str.lastIndexOf("the")); // output: 30

If you include a second parameter with the `lastIndexOf()` method, the search is
conducted from that index position in the string working backward (from right to
left):

    var str:String = "The moon, the stars, the sea, the land"
    trace(str.lastIndexOf("the", 29)); // output: 21

</div>

</div>

<div>

## Creating an array of substrings segmented by a delimiter

<div>

You can use the `split()` method to create an array of substrings, which is
divided based on a delimiter. For example, you can segment a comma-delimited or
tab-delimited string into multiple strings.

The following example shows how to split an array into substrings with the
ampersand (&) character as the delimiter:

    var queryStr:String = "first=joe&last=cheng&title=manager&StartDate=3/6/65";
    var params:Array = queryStr.split("&", 2); // params == ["first=joe","last=cheng"]

The second parameter of the `split()` method, which is optional, defines the
maximum size of the array that is returned.

You can also use a regular expression as the delimiter character:

    var str:String = "Give me\t5."
    var a:Array = str.split(/\s+/); // a == ["Give","me","5."]

## Finding patterns in strings and replacing substrings

<div>

The String class includes the following methods for working with patterns in
strings:

- Use the `match()` and `search()` methods to locate substrings that match a
  pattern.

- Use the `replace()` method to find substrings that match a pattern and replace
  them with a specified substring.

These methods are described in the following sections.

You can use strings or regular expressions to define patterns used in these
methods. For more information on regular expressions, see
[Using regular expressions](../using-regular-expressions/index.md).

#### Finding matching substrings

The `search()` method returns the index position of the first substring that
matches a given pattern, as shown in this example:

    var str:String = "The more the merrier.";
    // (This search is case-sensitive.)
    trace(str.search("the")); // output: 9

You can also use regular expressions to define the pattern to match, as this
example shows:

    var pattern:RegExp = /the/i;
    var str:String = "The more the merrier.";
    trace(str.search(pattern)); // 0

The output of the `trace()` method is 0, because the first character in the
string is index position 0. The `i` flag is set in the regular expression, so
the search is not case-sensitive.

The `search()` method finds only one match and returns its starting index
position, even if the `g` (global) flag is set in the regular expression.

The following example shows a more intricate regular expression, one that
matches a string in double quotation marks:

    var pattern:RegExp = /"[^"]*"/;
    var str:String = "The \"more\" the merrier.";
    trace(str.search(pattern)); // output: 4

    str = "The \"more the merrier.";
    trace(str.search(pattern)); // output: -1
    // (Indicates no match, since there is no closing double quotation mark.)

The `match()` method works similarly. It searches for a matching substring.
However, when you use the global flag in a regular expression pattern, as in the
following example, `match()` returns an array of matching substrings:

    var str:String = "bob@example.com, omar@example.org";
    var pattern:RegExp = /\w*@\w*\.[org|com]+/g;
    var results:Array = str.match(pattern);

The `results` array is set to the following:

    ["bob@example.com","omar@example.org"]

For more information on regular expressions, see
[Using regular expressions](../using-regular-expressions/index.md).

</div>

<div>

#### Replacing matched substrings

You can use the `replace()` method to search for a specified pattern in a string
and replace matches with the specified replacement string, as the following
example shows:

    var str:String = "She sells seashells by the seashore.";
    var pattern:RegExp = /sh/gi;
    trace(str.replace(pattern, "sch")); //sche sells seaschells by the seaschore.

Note that in this example, the matched strings are not case-sensitive because
the `i` (`ignoreCase`) flag is set in the regular expression, and multiple
matches are replaced because the `g` (`global`) flag is set. For more
information, see
[Using regular expressions](../using-regular-expressions/index.md).

You can include the following `$` replacement codes in the replacement string.
The replacement text shown in the following table is inserted in place of the
`$` replacement code:

<div>

| $ Code   | Replacement Text                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$$`     | $                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `$&`     | The matched substring.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `` $```  | The portion of the string that precedes the matched substring. This code uses the straight left single quotation mark character (`` ```), not the straight single quotation mark (`'`) or the left curly single quotation mark (`'`). |
| `$'`     | The portion of the string that follows the matched substring. This code uses the straight single quotation mark (`'`).                                                                                                                |
| `$` _n_  | The _n_ th captured parenthetical group match, where n is a single digit, 1-9, and $n is not followed by a decimal digit.                                                                                                             |
| `$` _nn_ | The _nn_ th captured parenthetical group match, where _nn_ is a two-digit decimal number, 01â€“99. If the _nn_ th capture is undefined, the replacement text is an empty string.                                                        |

</div>

For example, the following shows the use of the `$2` and `$1` replacement codes,
which represent the first and second capturing group matched:

    var str:String = "flip-flop";
    var pattern:RegExp = /(\w+)-(\w+)/g;
    trace(str.replace(pattern, "$2-$1")); // flop-flip

You can also use a function as the second parameter of the `replace()` method.
The matching text is replaced by the returned value of the function.

    var str:String = "Now only $9.95!";
    var price:RegExp = /\$([\d,]+.\d+)+/i;
    trace(str.replace(price, usdToEuro));

    function usdToEuro(matchedSubstring:String,                                  capturedMatch1:String,                                  index:int,                                  str:String):String
    {
        var usd:String = capturedMatch1;
        usd = usd.replace(",", "");
        var exchangeRate:Number = 0.853690;
        var euro:Number = parseFloat(usd) * exchangeRate;
        const euroSymbol:String = String.fromCharCode(8364);
        return euro.toFixed(2) + " " + euroSymbol;
    }

When you use a function as the second parameter of the `replace()` method, the
following arguments are passed to the function:

- The matching portion of the string.

- Any capturing parenthetical group matches. The number of arguments passed this
  way will vary depending on the number of parenthetical matches. You can
  determine the number of parenthetical matches by checking
  `arguments.length - 3` within the function code.

- The index position in the string where the match begins.

- The complete string.
