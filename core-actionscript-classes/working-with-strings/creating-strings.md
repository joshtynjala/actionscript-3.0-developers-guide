# Creating strings

<div>

The String class is used to represent string (textual) data in
ActionScript 3.0. ActionScript strings support both ASCII and Unicode
characters. The simplest way to create a string is to use a string
literal. To declare a string literal, use straight double quotation mark
( `"` ) or single quotation mark (
`'` ) characters. For example, the following
two strings are equivalent:

    var str1:String = "hello";
    var str2:String = 'hello';

You can also declare a string by using the
`new` operator, as follows:

    var str1:String = new String("hello");  
    var str2:String = new String(str1);
    var str3:String = new String();       // str3 == ""

The following two strings are equivalent:

    var str1:String = "hello";
    var str2:String = new String("hello");

To use single quotation marks ( `'` ) within
a string literal defined with single quotation mark (
`'` ) delimiters, use the backslash escape
character ( `\` ). Similarly, to use double
quotation marks ( `"` ) within a string
literal defined with double quotation marks (
`"` ) delimiters, use the backslash escape
character ( `\` ). The following two strings
are equivalent:

    var str1:String = "That's \"A-OK\"";
    var str2:String = 'That\'s "A-OK"';

You may choose to use single quotation marks or double quotation marks
based on any single or double quotation marks that exist in a string
literal, as in the following:

    var str1:String = "ActionScript <span class='heavy'>3.0</span>";
    var str2:String = '<item id="155">banana</item>';

Keep in mind that ActionScript distinguishes between a straight single
quotation mark ( `'` ) and a left or right
single quotation mark ( `'` or
`'` ). The same is true for double quotation
marks. Use straight quotation marks to delineate string literals. When
pasting text from another source into ActionScript, be sure to use the
correct characters.

As the following table shows, you can use the backslash escape character
( `\` ) to define other characters in string
literals:
