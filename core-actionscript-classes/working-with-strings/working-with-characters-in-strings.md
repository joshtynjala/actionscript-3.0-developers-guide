# Working with characters in strings

Every character in a string has an index position in the string (an integer).
The index position of the first character is 0. For example, in the following
string, the character `y` is in position 0 and the character `w` is in position
5:

    "yellow"

You can examine individual characters in various positions in a string using the
`charAt()` method and the `charCodeAt()` method, as in this example:

    var str:String = "hello world!";
    for (var i:int = 0; i < str.length; i++)
    {
        trace(str.charAt(i), "-", str.charCodeAt(i));
    }

When you run this code, the following output is produced:

    h - 104
    e - 101
    l - 108
    l - 108
    o - 111
      - 32
    w - 119
    o - 111
    r - 114
    l - 108
    d - 100
    ! - 33

You can also use character codes to define a string using the `fromCharCode()`
method, as the following example shows:

    var myStr:String = String.fromCharCode(104,101,108,108,111,32,119,111,114,108,100,33);
            // Sets myStr to "hello world!"
