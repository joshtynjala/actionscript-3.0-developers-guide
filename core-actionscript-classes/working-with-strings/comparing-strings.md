# Comparing strings

<div>

You can use the following operators to compare strings:
`<`, `<=`,
`!=`, `==`,
`=>`, and `>`.
These operators can be used with conditional statements, such as
`if` and `while`,
as the following example shows:

    var str1:String = "Apple";
    var str2:String = "apple";
    if (str1 < str2)
    {
        trace("A < a, B < b, C < c, ...");
    }

When using these operators with strings, ActionScript considers the
character code value of each character in the string, comparing
characters from left to right, as in the following:

    trace("A" < "B"); // true
    trace("A" < "a"); // true
    trace("Ab" < "az"); // true
    trace("abc" < "abza"); // true

Use the `==` and
`!=` operators to compare strings with each
other and to compare strings with other types of objects, as the
following example shows:

    var str1:String = "1";
    var str1b:String = "1";
    var str2:String = "2";
    trace(str1 == str1b); // true
    trace(str1 == str2); // false
    var total:uint = 1;
    trace(str1 == total); // true

</div>
