# Concatenating strings

<div>

Concatenation of strings means taking two strings and joining them sequentially
into one. For example, you can use the+` operator to concatenate two strings:

    var str1:String = "green";
    var str2:String = "ish";
    var str3:String = str1 + str2; // str3 == "greenish"

You can also use the `+=` operator to the produce the same result, as the
following example shows:

    var str:String = "green";
    str += "ish"; // str == "greenish"

Additionally, the String class includes a `concat()` method, which can be used
as follows:

    var str1:String = "Bonjour";
    var str2:String = "from";
    var str3:String = "Paris";
    var str4:String = str1.concat(" ", str2, " ", str3);
    // str4 == "Bonjour from Paris"

If you use the `+` operator (or the `+=` operator) with a String object and an
object that is _not_ a string, ActionScript automatically converts the nonstring
object to a String object in order to evaluate the expression, as shown in this
example:

    var str:String = "Area = ";
    var area:Number = Math.PI * Math.pow(3, 2);
    str = str + area; // str == "Area = 28.274333882308138"

However, you can use parentheses for grouping to provide context for the `+`
operator, as the following example shows:

    trace("Total: $" + 4.55 + 1.45); // output: Total: $4.551.45
    trace("Total: $" + (4.55 + 1.45)); // output: Total: $6
