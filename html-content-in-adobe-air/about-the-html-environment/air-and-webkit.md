# AIR and WebKit

<div>

Adobe AIR uses the open source WebKit engine, also used in the Safari web
browser. AIR adds several extensions to allow access to the runtime classes and
objects as well as for security. In addition, WebKit itself adds features not
included in the W3C standards for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Only the AIR additions and the most noteworthy WebKit extensions are covered
here; for additional documentation on non-standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
see [www.webkit.org](http://www.webkit.org) and
[developer.apple.com](http://developer.apple.com/internet/safari/). For
standards information, see the [W3C web site](http://www.w3.org/). Mozilla also
provides a valuable
[general reference](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Main_Page) on HTML,
CSS, and DOM topics (of course, the WebKit and Mozilla engines are not
identical).
