# CSS in AIR

WebKit supports several extended CSS properties. Many of these extensions use
the prefix: `-webkit`. Note that some of these extensions are experimental in
nature and may be removed from a future version of WebKit. For more information
about the Webkit support for CSS and its extensions to CSS, see
[Safari CSS Reference](http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Introduction.html).
