# Basics of filtering display objects

<div>

One of the ways to add polish to an application is to add simple graphic
effects. You can add a drop shadow behind a photo to create the illusion of 3-d,
or a glow around a button to show that it is active. ActionScript 3.0 includes
ten filters that you can apply to any display object or to a BitmapData
instance. The built-in filters range from basic, such as the drop shadow and
glow filters, to complex, such as the displacement map filter and the
convolution filter.

Note: In addition to the built-in filters, you can also program custom filters
and effects using Pixel Bender. See
[Working with Pixel Bender shaders](../working-with-pixel-bender-shaders/index.md).

#### Important concepts and terms

The following reference list contains important terms that you might encounter
when creating filters:

Bevel  
An edge created by lightening pixels on two sides and darkening pixels on the
opposite two sides. This effect creates the appearance of a three-dimensional
border. The effect is commonly used for raised or indented buttons and similar
graphics.

Convolution  
Distorting pixels in an image by combining each pixel's value with the values of
some or all of its neighboring pixels, using various ratios.

Displacement  
Shifting or moving pixels in an image to a new position.

Matrix  
A grid of numbers used to perform certain mathematical calculations by applying
the numbers in the grid to various values, then combining the results.
