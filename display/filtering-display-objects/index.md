# Filtering display objects

Historically, the application of filter effects to bitmap images has been the
domain of specialized image-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop® and Adobe
Fireworks®. ActionScript 3.0 includes the flash.filters package, which contains
a series of bitmap effect filter classes. These effects allow developers to
programmatically apply filters to bitmaps and display objects and achieve many
of the same effects that are available in graphics manipulation applications.
