# Working with MovieClip objects

When you publish a SWF file, Flash converts all movie clip symbol instances on
the Stage to MovieClip objects. You can make a movie clip symbol available to
ActionScript by giving it an instance name in the Instance Name field of the
Property inspector. When the SWF file is created, Flash generates the code that
creates the MovieClip instance on the Stage and declares a variable using the
instance name. If you have named movie clips that are nested inside other named
movie clips, those child movie clips are treated like properties of the parent
movie clipâ€”you can access the child movie clip using dot syntax. For example, if
a movie clip with the instance name `childClip` is nested within another clip
with the instance name `parentClip`, you can make the child clip's timeline
animation play by calling this code:

    parentClip.childClip.play();

> **Note:** : Children instances placed on the Stage in the Flash authoring tool
> cannot be accessed by code from within the constructor of a parent instance
> since they have not been created at that point in code execution. Before
> accessing the child, the parent must instead either create the child instance
> by code or delay access to a callback function that listens for the child to
> dispatch its `Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE` event.

While some legacy methods and properties of the ActionScript 2.0 MovieClip class
remain the same, others have changed. All properties prefixed with an underscore
have been renamed. For example, `_width` and `_height` properties are now
accessed as `width` and `height`, while `_xscale` and `_yscale` are now accessed
as `scaleX` and `scaleY`. For a complete list of the properties and methods of
the MovieClip class, consult the

class listing in the
