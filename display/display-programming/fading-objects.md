# Fading objects

<div>

You can control the transparency of a display object to make it partially (or
completely transparent), or change the transparency to make the object appear to
fade in or out. The DisplayObject classâ€™s `alpha` property defines the
transparency (or more accurately, the opacity) of a display object. The `alpha`
property can be set to any value between 0 and 1, where 0 is completely
transparent, and 1 is completely opaque. For example, these lines of code make
the object named `myBall` partially (50 percent) transparent when it is clicked
with the mouse:

    function fadeBall(event:MouseEvent):void
    {
    	myBall.alpha = .5;
    }
    myBall.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, fadeBall);

You can also alter the transparency of a display object using the color
adjustments available through the ColorTransform class. For more information,
see [Adjusting DisplayObject colors](./adjusting-display-object-colors.md).
