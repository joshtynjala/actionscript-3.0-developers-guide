# Manipulating display objects

<div>

Regardless of which display object you choose to use, there are a number of
manipulations that all display objects have in common as elements that are
displayed on the screen. For example, they can all be positioned on the screen,
moved forward or backward in the stacking order of display objects, scaled,
rotated, and so forth. Because all display objects inherit this functionality
from their common base class (DisplayObject), this functionality behaves the
same whether you're manipulating a TextField instance, a Video instance, a Shape
instance, or any other display object. The following sections detail several of
these common display object manipulations.
