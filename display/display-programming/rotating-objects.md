# Rotating objects

Display objects can be rotated using the `rotation` property. You can read this
value to find out whether an object has been rotated, or to rotate the object
you can set this property to a number (in degrees) representing the amount of
rotation to be applied to the object. For instance, this line of code rotates
the object named `square` 45 degrees (one eighth of one complete revolution):

    square.rotation = 45;

Alternatively, you can rotate a display object using a transformation matrix,
described in [Working with geometry](../working-with-geometry/index.md).
