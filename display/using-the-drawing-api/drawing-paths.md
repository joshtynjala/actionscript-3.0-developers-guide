# Drawing Paths

The section on drawing lines and curves (see
[Drawing lines and curves](./drawing-lines-and-curves.md)) introduced the
commands for drawing a single line (`Graphics.lineTo()`) or curve
(`Graphics.curveTo()`) and then moving the line to another point
(`Graphics.moveTo()`) to form a shape. The `Graphics.drawPath()` and
`Graphics.drawTriangles()` methods accept a set of objects representing those
same drawing commands as a parameter. With these methods, you can provide a
series of `Graphics.lineTo()`, `Graphics.curveTo()`, or `Graphics.moveTo()`
commands for the Flash runtime to execute in a single statement.

The <a
href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/display/GraphicsPathCommand.html"
target="_self">GraphicsPathCommand</a> enumeration class defines a set of
constants that correspond to drawing commands. You pass a series of these
constants (wrapped in a Vector instance) as a parameter for the
`Graphics.drawPath()` method. Then with a single command you can render an
entire shape, or several shapes. You can also alter the values passed to these
methods to change an existing shape.

In addition to the Vector of drawing commands, the `drawPath()` method needs a
set of coordinates that correspond to the coordinates for each drawing command.
Create a Vector instance containing coordinates (Number instances) and pass it
to the `drawPath()` method as the second (`data`) argument.

Note: The values in the vector are not Point objects; the vector is a series of
numbers where each group of two numbers represents an x/y coordinate pair.

The `Graphics.drawPath()` method matches each command with its respective point
values (a collection of two or four numbers) to generate a path in the Graphics
object:

    package
    {
        import flash.display.*;

        public class DrawPathExample extends Sprite
        {
            public function DrawPathExample(){

                var squareCommands:Vector.<int> = new Vector.<int>(5, true);
                squareCommands[0] = GraphicsPathCommand.MOVE_TO;
                squareCommands[1] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;
                squareCommands[2] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;
                squareCommands[3] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;
                squareCommands[4] = GraphicsPathCommand.LINE_TO;

                var squareCoord:Vector.<Number> = new Vector.<Number>(10, true);
                squareCoord[0] = 20; //x
                squareCoord[1] = 10; //y
                squareCoord[2] = 50;
                squareCoord[3] = 10;
                squareCoord[4] = 50;
                squareCoord[5] = 40;
                squareCoord[6] = 20;
                squareCoord[7] = 40;
                squareCoord[8] = 20;
                squareCoord[9] = 10;

                graphics.beginFill(0x442266);//set the color
                graphics.drawPath(squareCommands, squareCoord);
            }
        }
    }
