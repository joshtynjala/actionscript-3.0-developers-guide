# Using the Math class with drawing methods

<div>

A Graphics object draws circles and squares, but can also draw more complex
forms, particularly when the drawing methods are used in combination with the
properties and methods of the Math class. The Math class contains constants of
common mathematical interest, such as `Math.PI` (approximately 3.14159265...), a
constant for the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter. It also
contains methods for trigonometry functions, including `Math.sin()`,
`Math.cos()`, and `Math.tan()` among others. Drawing shapes using these methods
and constants create more dynamic visual effects, particularly when used with
repetition or recursion.

Many methods of the Math class expect circular measurements in units of radians
rather than degrees. Converting between these two types of units is a common use
of the Math class:

    var degrees = 121;
    var radians = degrees * Math.PI / 180;
    trace(radians) // 2.111848394913139

The following example creates a sine wave and a cosine wave, to highlight the
difference between the `Math.sin()` and `Math.cos()` methods for a given value.

    var sinWavePosition = 100;
    var cosWavePosition = 200;
    var sinWaveColor:uint = 0xFF0000;
    var cosWaveColor:uint = 0x00FF00;
    var waveMultiplier:Number = 10;
    var waveStretcher:Number = 5;

    var i:uint;
    for(i = 1; i < stage.stageWidth; i++)
    {
    var sinPosY:Number = Math.sin(i / waveStretcher) * waveMultiplier;
    var cosPosY:Number = Math.cos(i / waveStretcher) * waveMultiplier;

    graphics.beginFill(sinWaveColor);
    graphics.drawRect(i, sinWavePosition + sinPosY, 2, 2);
    graphics.beginFill(cosWaveColor);
    graphics.drawRect(i, cosWavePosition + cosPosY, 2, 2);
    }
