# About using drawTriangles()

<div>

Another advanced method introduced in Flash Player 10 and Adobe AIR 1.5,
`Graphics.drawTriangles()`, is like the `Graphics.drawPath()` method. The
`Graphics.drawTriangles()` method also uses a Vector.\<Number\> object to
specify point locations for drawing a path.

However, the real purpose for the `Graphics.drawTriangles()` method is to
facilitate three-dimensional effects through ActionScript. For information about
using `Graphics.drawTriangles()` to produce three-dimensional effects, see
[Using triangles for 3D effects](../working-in-three-dimensions-3d/using-triangles-for-3d-effects.md).
