# Using the DRMStatusEvent class

<div>

A NetStream object dispatches a DRMStatusEvent object when the content protected
by Adobe Access begins playing successfully. (Success implies that the license
is verified and that the user is authenticated and authorized to view the
content). The DRMStatusEvent is also dispatched for anonymous users if they are
permitted access. The license is checked to verify whether anonymous users, who
do not require authentication, are allowed access to play the content. Anonymous
users maybe denied access for various reasons. For example, an anonymous user
does not have access to the content when the license has expired.

The DRMStatusEvent object contains information related to the license. Such
information includes whether the license can be made available offline or when
the voucher expires and the content can no longer be viewed. The application can
use this data to convey the user's policy status and its permissions.

## DRMStatusEvent properties

<div>

The DRMStatusEvent class includes the following properties. Some properties
became available in versions of AIR later than 1.0. For complete version
information, see the
[ActionScript 3.0 Reference for the Adobe Flash Platform](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/index.html).

For properties that aren't supported in Flash Player 10.1, the DRMVoucher class
provides similar properties for Flash Player.

## Creating a DRMStatusEvent handler

<div>

The following example creates an event handler that outputs the DRM content
status information for the NetStream object that originated the event. Add this
event handler to a NetStream object that points to protected content.

    function drmStatusEventHandler(event:DRMStatusEvent):void
    {
    	trace(event);
    }
    function drmStatusEventHandler(event:DRMStatusEvent):void
    {
    	trace(event);
    }
