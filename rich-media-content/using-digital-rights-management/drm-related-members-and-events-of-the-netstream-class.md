# DRM-related members and events of the NetStream class

<div>

The NetStream class provides a one-way streaming connection between Flash Player
or an AIR application, and either Flash Media Server or the local file system.
(The NetStream class also supports progressive download.) A NetStream object is
a channel within a NetConnection object. The NetStream class dispatches four
DRM-related events:

<div>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Event</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td headers="d17e36230 "><p>drmAuthenticate</p>
<p>(AIR only)</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36233 "><p>Defined in
the DRMAuthenticateEvent class. This event is dispatched when a
NetStream object tries to play protected content that requires a user
credential for authentication before playback.</p>
<p>The properties of this event include header, usernamePrompt,
passwordPrompt, and urlPrompt properties that can be used in obtaining
and setting the user's credentials. This event occurs repeatedly until
the NetStream object receives valid user credentials.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td headers="d17e36230 "><p>drmError</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36233 "><p>Defined in
the DRMErrorEvent class and dispatched when a NetStream object tries to
play protected content and encounters a DRM-related error. For example,
DRM error event object is dispatched when the user authorization fails.
This error could occur because the user has not purchased the rights to
view the content. It could also occur because the content provider does
not support the viewing application.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td headers="d17e36230 "><p>drmStatus</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36233 "><p>Defined in
the DRMStatusEvent class. This event is dispatched when the protected
content begins playing (when the user is authenticated and authorized to
play the content). The DRMStatusEvent object contains information
related to the voucher. Voucher information includes whether the content
can be made available offline or when the voucher expires and the
content can no longer be viewed.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td headers="d17e36230 "><p>status</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36233 "><p>Defined in
events.StatusEvent and only dispatched when the application attempts to
play protected content, by invoking the NetStream.play() method. The
value of the status code property is "DRM.encryptedFLV".</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

The NetStream class includes the following DRM-specific methods, for use in AIR
only:

<div>

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%" />
<col style="width: 50%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><p>Method</p></th>
<th><p>Description</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td headers="d17e36277 "><p>resetDRMVouchers()</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36280 "><p>Deletes all
the locally cached digital rights management (DRM) voucher data. The
application must download the vouchers again for the user to be able to
access the encrypted content.</p>
<p>For example, the following code removes all vouchers from the
cache:</p>
<p>NetStream.resetDRMVouchers();</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td headers="d17e36277 "><p>setDRMAuthenticationCredentials()</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36280 "><p>Passes a set
of authentication credentials, namely user name, password, and
authentication type, to the NetStream object for authentication. Valid
authentication types are <samp>"drm"</samp> and <samp>"proxy"</samp>.
With <samp>"drm"</samp> authentication type, the credentials provided
are authenticated against Adobe Access. With <samp>"proxy"</samp>
authentication type, the credentials authenticate against the proxy
server and must match the credentials required by the proxy server. For
example, an enterprise can require the application to authenticate
against a proxy server before the user can access the Internet. The
proxy option allows this type of authentication. Unless anonymous
authentication is used, after the proxy authentication, the user must
still authenticate against Adobe Access to obtain the voucher and play
the content. You can use <samp>setDRMAuthenticationCredentials()</samp>
a second time, with " <samp>drm</samp> " option, to authenticate against
Adobe Access.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td headers="d17e36277 "><p>preloadEmbeddedMetadata()</p></td>
<td headers="d17e36280 "><p>Parses a
local media file for embedded metadata. When DRM-related metadata is
found, AIR calls the <samp>onDRMContentData()</samp> callback
function.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</div>

In addition, in AIR, a NetStream object calls the `onDRMContentData()` and
`onPlayStatus()` callback functions as a result of a call to the
`preloadEmbeddedMetaData()` method. The `onDRMContentData()` function is called
when DRM metadata is encountered in a media file. The `onPlayStatus()` function
is called when the file has been parsed. The `onDRMContentData()` and
`onPlayStatus()` functions must be defined on the `client` object assigned to
the NetStream instance. If you use the same NetStream object to preload vouchers
and play content, wait for the `onPlayStatus()` call generated by
`preloadEmbeddedMetaData()` before starting playback.

In the following code for AIR, user name ("administrator"), password
("password") and the "drm" authentication type are set for authenticating the
user. The setDRMAuthenticationCredentials() method must provide credentials that
match credentials known and accepted by the content provider. These credentials
are the same user credentials that permit the user to view the content. The code
for playing the video and making sure that a successful connection to the video
stream has been made is not included here.

    var connection:NetConnection = new NetConnection();
    connection.connect(null);

    var videoStream:NetStream = new NetStream(connection);

    videoStream.addEventListener(DRMAuthenticateEvent.DRM_AUTHENTICATE,
                            drmAuthenticateEventHandler)

    private function drmAuthenticateEventHandler(event:DRMAuthenticateEvent):void
    {
    	videoStream.setDRMAuthenticationCredentials("administrator", "password", "drm");
    }
