# Factory reset

When the user of the device invokes the factory reset option, the device
certificate will be purged. To continue playing the protected content, the Flash
application will need to go through the device registration procedure again. If
the Flash application sends an outdated pre-generated license, the Adobe Access
client will reject it since the license was encrypted for an older device ID.
