# Basics of the client system environment

<div>

As you build more advanced applications, you may find a need to know details
about—and access functions of—your users' operating systems. The flash.system
package contains a collection of classes that allow you to access system-level
functionality such as the following:

- Determining which application and security domain code is executing in

- Determining the capabilities of the user's Flash runtime (such as Flash®
  Player or Adobe® AIR™) instance, such as the screen size (resolution) and
  whether certain functionality is available, such as mp3 audio

- Building multilingual sites using the IME

- Interacting with the Flash runtime's container (which could be an HTML page or
  a container application).

- Saving information to the user's clipboard

The flash.system package also includes the IMEConversionMode and SecurityPanel
classes. These classes contain static constants that you use with the IME and
Security classes, respectively.
