# Using workers for concurrency

ActionScript workers make it possible to execute code concurrently, or in other
words, to execute code in the background without interrupting the main code's
execution.

The ActionScript concurrency apis are available on desktop platforms only in
Flash Player 11.4 and later, and AIR 3.4 and later. Concurrency is not supported
in AIR for mobile platforms.
