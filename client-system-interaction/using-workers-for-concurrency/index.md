# Using workers for concurrency

<div>

ActionScript workers make it possible to execute code concurrently, or in other
words, to execute code in the background without interrupting the main codeâ€™s
execution.

The ActionScript concurrency apis are available on desktop platforms only in
Flash Player 11.4 and later, and AIR 3.4 and later. Concurrency is not supported
in AIR for mobile platforms.
