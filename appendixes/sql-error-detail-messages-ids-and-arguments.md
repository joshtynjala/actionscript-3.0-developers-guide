# SQL error detail messages, ids, and arguments

<div>

The SQLError class represents various errors that can occur while working with
an Adobe AIR local SQL database. For any given exception, the SQLError instance
has a `details` property containing an English error message. In addition, each
error message has an associated unique identifier that is available in the
SQLError objectâ€™s `detailID` property. Using the `detailID` property, an
application can identify the specific details error message. The application can
provide alternate text for the end user in the language of his or her locale.
The argument values in the `detailArguments` array can be substituted in the
appropriate position in the error message string. This is useful for
applications that display the `details` property error message for an error
directly to end users in a specific locale.

The following table contains a list of the `detailID` values and the associated
English error message text. Placeholder text in the messages indicates where
`detailArguments` values are substituted in by the runtime. This list can be
used as a source for localizing the error messages that can occur in SQL
database operations.
