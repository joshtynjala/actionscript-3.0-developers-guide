# Storing local data

You use the
[SharedObject](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/net/SharedObject.html)
class to store small amounts of data on the client computer. In Adobe AIR, you
can also use the
[EncryptedLocalStore](https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/data/EncryptedLocalStore.html)
class to store small amounts of privacy-sensitive user data on the local
computer in an AIR application.

You can also read and write files on the file system and (in Adobe AIR) access
local database files. For more information, see

and

There are a number of security factors that relate to shared objects. For more
