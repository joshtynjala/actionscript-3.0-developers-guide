# Using the Flash Text Engine

The Adobe® Flash® Text Engine (FTE), available starting with Flash Player 10 and
Adobe® AIR™1.5, provides low-level support for sophisticated control of text
metrics, formatting, and bi-directional text. It offers improved text flow and
enhanced language support. While it can be used to create and manage simple text
elements, the FTE is primarily designed as a foundation for developers to create
text-handling components. As such, Flash Text Engine assumes a more advanced
level of programming expertise. To display simple text elements, see
[Using the TextField class](../using-the-textfield-class/index.md).

The Text Layout Framework, which includes a text-handling component based on the
FTE, provides an easier way to use its advanced features. The Text Layout
Framework is an extensible library built entirely in ActionScript 3.0. You can
use the existing TLF component, or use the framework to build your own text
component. For more information, see
[Using the Text Layout Framework](../using-the-text-layout-framework.md).
